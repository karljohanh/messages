# messages - A simple webchat application created by Johan Hermansson & Marcus Oskarsson.


The application uses express-session and mongoDB to create and store session a session cookie in the frontend as well as in the database for authorization.
We're using Socket.IO as the WebSocket-library for low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between the client and the server.

The chat offers login, registration & authorization, a few pre-determined rooms as well as direct messaging between online users.
