# messages - A simple webchat application created by Johan Hermansson & Marcus Oskarsson.


The application uses express-session and mongoDB to create and store session a session cookie in the frontend as well as in the database for authorization.
We're using Socket.IO as the WebSocket-library for low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between the client and the server.

The chat offers login, registration & authorization, a few pre-determined rooms as well as direct messaging between online users.

Our Goal

Our goal was to create a user-friendly chat application utilizing modern web technologies. We established secure session management using express-session and MongoDB. We also used Socket.IO for fast messaging and easy switching between pre-determined rooms and direct messaging. We aimed to improve our skills in backend development, React, web sockets.
